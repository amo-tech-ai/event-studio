Based on the Hi.Events documentation you've shared, here are the detailed steps to install and set up Hi.Events locally for development:

## 🚀 **Hi.Events Local Development Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Docker** - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. **Docker Compose** - Comes with Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac
3. **Git** - [Git Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### **Installation Steps**

#### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HiEventsDev/hi.events.git
cd hi.events
```

#### **Step 2: Navigate to Development Docker Setup**
```bash
cd docker/development
```

#### **Step 3: Run the Installation Script**
```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

This script will:
- Start all necessary Docker containers
- Generate SSL certificates for localhost

#### **Step 4: Access the Application**
After the setup completes, you can access:

- **Frontend**: `https://localhost:8443`
- **Backend/API**: `https://localhost:8443/api`

### **Additional Configuration**

#### **Environment Variables**
The development environment uses a `.env` file in the `docker/development` directory. You can customize:
- Mail service settings
- Object storage configuration  
- Application settings

#### **Stripe Webhooks (for Payment Testing)**
To test Stripe payments end-to-end:

1. Install [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Run the webhook listener:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8443/api/public/webhooks/stripe
```

#### **SSL Certificate Options**
The default setup generates an unsigned SSL certificate. For a signed certificate:

1. Install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
2. Run:
```bash
mkcert -install
./start-dev.sh --cert=signed
```
