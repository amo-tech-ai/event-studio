**Purpose:** Quick reference for executing the multi-step dashboard fix process.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXECUTION SEQUENCE**

### **STEP 1: Infrastructure (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)**
```bash
# 1.1 Database Connection Validation
"Validate all Supabase database connections and ensure the dashboard is connected to the local Supabase instance. Check that all main stats (upcoming events, total bookings, tickets sold) are displaying real data from the database."

# 1.2 TypeScript Types Integration  
"Generate and integrate TypeScript types for the Supabase database schema. Update the Supabase client configuration to use the generated types for better type safety."

# 1.3 Authentication System
"Verify the authentication bypass system is working correctly for development. Ensure VITE_DISABLE_AUTH is properly configured and the ProtectedRoute component is functioning."
```

### **STEP 2: Shared Components (FOUNDATION)**
```bash
# 2.1 Dashboard Shared Components
"Create reusable dashboard components in src/components/dashboard/. Include: DashboardCard, StatsCard, LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary, EmptyState, and Pagination components."

# 2.2 Data Fetching Hooks
"Create comprehensive React Query hooks for all dashboard data. Include: useEvents, useBookings, useTickets, useVenues, useAnalytics, useDashboardStats."

# 2.3 Utility Functions
"Create utility functions for data formatting, date handling, currency formatting, and status mapping. Place these in src/utils/dashboard.ts with proper TypeScript types."
```

### **STEP 3: Feature Modules (CORE)**
```bash
# 3.1 Events Feature Module
"Complete the Events feature module in src/features/events/. Implement: EventCard, EventList, EventFilters, EventForm, EventDetails components with full CRUD operations."

# 3.2 Bookings Feature Module
"Create the Bookings feature module in src/features/bookings/. Implement: BookingCard, BookingList, BookingFilters, BookingDetails components connected to the orders table."

# 3.3 Analytics Feature Module
"Build the Analytics feature module in src/features/analytics/. Include: RevenueChart, AttendanceChart, EventPerformanceChart, and DashboardMetrics components."

# 3.4 Venues Feature Module
"Develop the Venues feature module in src/features/venues/. Create: VenueCard, VenueList, VenueForm, VenueDetails components with proper venue management."
```

### **STEP 4: Page Fixes (IMPLEMENTATION)**
```bash
# 4.1 Dashboard Home Page
"Fix the main dashboard page (src/pages/Dashboard.tsx). Ensure all main stats display real data, implement proper loading and error states, and add quick action buttons."

# 4.2 Events Page
"Complete the Events page (src/pages/DashboardEvents.tsx). Implement: search functionality, filtering by status/type, sorting options, pagination, and bulk actions."

# 4.3 Bookings Page
"Fix the Bookings page (src/pages/DashboardBookings.tsx). Replace mock data with real booking information from the orders table with booking status management."

# 4.4 Analytics Page
"Build the Analytics page (src/pages/DashboardAnalytics.tsx). Create comprehensive analytics dashboard with revenue charts, attendance metrics, and customer insights."

# 4.5 Venues Page
"Develop the Venues page (src/pages/DashboardVenues.tsx). Display all venues with capacity information, amenities, location details, and venue management tools."

# 4.6 Settings Page
"Create the Settings page (src/pages/DashboardSettings.tsx). Include: user profile management, notification preferences, API settings, and system configuration."
```

## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check Supabase local instance is running
   - Verify environment variables
   - Test database queries directly

2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Regenerate database types
   - Check import paths
   - Validate type definitions

3. **Component Not Rendering**
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify component imports
   - Test with simple placeholder

4. **Data Not Loading**
   - Check React Query configuration
   - Verify API endpoints
   - Test with direct database queries
