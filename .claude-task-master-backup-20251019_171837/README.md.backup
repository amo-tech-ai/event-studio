During the 2025-10-19 reorganization, the following were moved to appropriate locations:

### Moved to `notes/duplicates/`
- 16 duplicate files from core, event-wizard, and other folders
- **20-BUILD_GUIDE.md** (duplicate of 04-BUILD-GUIDE.md)

### Moved to `mermaid/`
- 18-JOURNEYS.md
- 19-DIAGRAMS.md

### Moved to `research/competitive-analysis/`
- 01-breef-design-analysis.md
- 01-CopilotKit-Tavily-Event-Management-Analysis.md
- 01-EventOS-Complete-Feature-Roadmap.md

## ✅ Best Practices

### When to Add Files Here
✅ **DO add:**
- Build and deployment guides
- Technology stack documentation
- Product requirements documents
- Risk assessments
- System analysis
- Reusable templates and prompts

❌ **DON'T add:**
- Implementation code
- Feature-specific documentation (use feature folders)
- Research and competitive analysis (use `research/`)
- AI planning materials (use `agents/`)
- Diagrams (use `mermaid/`)
- Progress reports (use `progress/`)
- Duplicate documents (check if exists elsewhere first)

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `04-TECH-STACK.md`, `MVP-PRD.md`
- Prefix with numbers for ordering: `01-`, `02-`, etc.
- Use UPPER-CASE-WITH-HYPHENS for main files
- Keep names concise but clear

- **Categories:** 2 main categories (Architecture & Planning, Technical Reference)
- **Organization:** Clean and focused, sequential ordering
- **Duplicates:** 0 (all removed)
- **Status:** Production ready
