## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Migration to Production

- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/asrzdtpyrdgyggqdfwwl
- [ ] Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
- [ ] Click **"New Query"** button
- [ ] Copy entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20251013044316_core_eventos_schema.sql`
- [ ] Paste into SQL Editor
- [ ] Click **"Run"** button (or `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`)
- [ ] Wait for execution to complete
- [ ] Verify success message appears

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

Run each verification query in SQL Editor:

#### 2.1 Verify Tables Created
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```
- [ ] Confirmed: 6 tables (attendees, events, orders, profiles, tickets, venues)

#### 2.2 Verify RLS Enabled
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```
- [ ] Confirmed: All 6 tables show `rowsecurity = true`

#### 2.3 Verify Functions Exist
```sql
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
  AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION'
ORDER BY routine_name;
```
- [ ] Confirmed: 5 functions created

#### 2.4 Verify Triggers Active
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY event_object_table, trigger_name;
```
- [ ] Confirmed: 10 triggers active

#### 2.5 Verify RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```
- [ ] Confirmed: 16 policies across all tables

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

#### 3.1 Get Service Role Key
- [ ] Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API
- [ ] Copy "service_role" key (not anon key!)
- [ ] Add to `.env` file:
  ```env
  SUPABASE_URL=https://asrzdtpyrdgyggqdfwwl.supabase.co
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-service-role-key>
  ```
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (DO NOT COMMIT)

**Time Estimate:** 1 minute

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

- [ ] Dependencies installed successfully

**Time Estimate:** 30 seconds

---

### Step 5: Seed Auth Users

```bash
node --env-file=.env scripts/seed-auth-users.mjs
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Created: sofia.martinez@toronto-events.local
‚úÖ Created: carlos.lopez@toronto-events.local
‚úÖ Created: ana.rodriguez@toronto-events.local
‚úÖ Created: diego.sanchez@toronto-events.local
‚úÖ Created: maria.garcia@toronto-events.local

‚úÖ Auth user seeding complete!
```

- [ ] All 5 users created successfully
- [ ] No errors in output

**Time Estimate:** 1 minute

---

### Step 6: Verify Auth Users

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name' as full_name,
  raw_user_meta_data->>'company' as company,
  email_confirmed_at,
  created_at
FROM auth.users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

- [ ] Confirmed: 5 users exist
- [ ] Confirmed: All emails confirmed (`email_confirmed_at` is not null)
- [ ] Confirmed: Metadata populated (full_name, company)

**Time Estimate:** 1 minute

---

### Step 7: Backfill Profiles (if needed)

Check if profiles were auto-created:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM public.profiles;
```

If count is **less than 5**, run backfill:

```sql
-- Copy from scripts/backfill-profiles.sql
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, company, phone)
SELECT
  au.id,
  au.email,
  au.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name',
  au.raw_user_meta_data->>'company',
  au.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone'
FROM auth.users au
WHERE au.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM public.profiles)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

Verify profiles:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  full_name,
  company,
  phone,
  created_at
FROM public.profiles
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

- [ ] Confirmed: 5 profiles exist
- [ ] Confirmed: All fields populated

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 minutes

---

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Test 1: RLS Policies (Anonymous)

```sql
SET ROLE anon;

-- Should return only published public events
SELECT count(*) FROM public.events WHERE status = 'published' AND visibility = 'public';

-- Should return 0 (anon can't see orders)
SELECT count(*) FROM public.orders;

RESET ROLE;
```

- [ ] Anonymous queries work as expected

### Test 2: Auto-Generation Triggers

Create a test event to verify triggers:

```sql
-- Get a user ID
SELECT id FROM public.profiles LIMIT 1;

-- Insert test event (use the ID from above)
INSERT INTO public.events (organizer_id, name, type, start_at, end_at, capacity, price_cents)
VALUES (
  '<user-id-here>',
  'Test Event',
  'conference',
  now() + interval '1 week',
  now() + interval '1 week' + interval '3 hours',
  100,
  5000
)
RETURNING id, slug, created_at, updated_at;
```

- [ ] Event created successfully
- [ ] `slug` auto-generated (format: `test-event-<8-char-id>`)
- [ ] `created_at` and `updated_at` populated

Clean up:

```sql
DELETE FROM public.events WHERE name = 'Test Event';
```

- [ ] Test event deleted

### Test 3: Stripe Idempotency

Attempt to create duplicate order with same payment intent:

```sql
-- Get user and event IDs
SELECT id FROM public.profiles LIMIT 1;
SELECT id FROM public.events LIMIT 1;

-- First order
INSERT INTO public.orders (customer_id, event_id, order_number, quantity, unit_price_cents, total_cents, stripe_payment_intent_id)
VALUES (
  '<customer-id>',
  '<event-id>',
  'TEST-001',
  2,
  5000,
  10000,
  'pi_test_duplicate_check'
)
RETURNING id, order_number;

-- Attempt duplicate (should fail)
INSERT INTO public.orders (customer_id, event_id, order_number, quantity, unit_price_cents, total_cents, stripe_payment_intent_id)
VALUES (
  '<customer-id>',
  '<event-id>',
  'TEST-002',
  2,
  5000,
  10000,
  'pi_test_duplicate_check'  -- Same payment intent
);
```

- [ ] First order created successfully
- [ ] Second order **FAILED** with unique constraint violation
- [ ] Error message mentions `idx_orders_stripe_payment_intent_id`

Clean up:

```sql
DELETE FROM public.orders WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id = 'pi_test_duplicate_check';
```

- [ ] Test order deleted

**Time Estimate:** 5 minutes

## üéØ Final Verification

Run this comprehensive check:

```sql
-- Summary query
SELECT
  (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public') as tables,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_schema = 'public') as functions,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_schema = 'public') as triggers,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public') as policies,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM auth.users) as auth_users,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM public.profiles) as profiles;
```

Expected result:
```
tables    | 6
functions | 5
triggers  | 10
policies  | 16
auth_users| 5
profiles  | 5
```

- [ ] All counts match expected values
