 Plan: Integrating Claude Code Workflows & Agents into EventOS

  Overview

  This plan will integrate the comprehensive claude-code-workflows marketplace (36 plugins, 84 agents, 15 orchestrators,
   42 tools) into your EventOS project to accelerate development and improve code quality.

  Phase 1: Initial Setup & Core Plugins

  1.1 Add Marketplace

  /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/wshobson/agents

  1.2 Install Essential Plugins

  Priority 1 - Daily Development:
  - claude-code-essentials - Debugging, code review, git workflows
  - full-stack-development - End-to-end feature orchestration
  - database-operations - Supabase schema optimization, query tuning

  Priority 2 - Core Functionality:
  - api-scaffolding - REST API generation for your Next.js/FastAPI backend
  - testing-quality-suite - TDD workflows, automated testing
  - security-scanning - OWASP compliance, vulnerability scanning

  Priority 3 - Infrastructure:
  - deployment-orchestration - CI/CD for Vercel/Railway deployment
  - observability-monitoring - Production monitoring setup

  Phase 2: EventOS-Specific Use Cases

  2.1 Chat Wizard Enhancement

  Agents to use:
  - frontend-developer - React/Next.js component optimization
  - ui-ux-designer - Design system improvements
  - accessibility-compliance - WCAG validation

  Workflow:
  "Use frontend-developer to optimize the chat wizard components for better performance"
  "Have ui-ux-designer review the chat interface design system"

  2.2 CRM Development

  Multi-agent workflow:
  "Implement CRM contact management feature"
  → backend-architect (API design)
  → database-architect (schema design)
  → frontend-developer (UI components)
  → test-automator (test suite)
  → security-auditor (security review)

  Plugins:
  - full-stack-development - Orchestrates entire feature
  - database-operations - Supabase schema design
  - api-testing-observability - API testing & monitoring

  2.3 Dashboard Optimization

  Agents:
  - performance-engineer - Profile and optimize dashboard loading
  - database-optimizer - Query optimization for analytics
  - observability-engineer - Add monitoring/tracing

  Example:
  "Use performance-engineer to analyze dashboard loading times and optimize"

  2.4 Authentication & Security

  Workflow:
  "Implement secure authentication system with Supabase"
  → backend-security-coder (secure auth patterns)
  → security-auditor (OWASP compliance check)
  → test-automator (security test suite)

  Slash command available:
  - /database-operations:sql-migrations - Zero-downtime auth schema migrations

  Phase 3: Advanced Workflows

  3.1 Multi-Agent Feature Development

  Pattern for new features:
  # Example: Implement event analytics dashboard

  1. Architecture Phase:
     "Use backend-architect to design the analytics API architecture"
     "Have database-architect design the events tracking schema"

  2. Implementation Phase:
     "Use api-scaffolding to generate FastAPI endpoints for analytics"
     "Have frontend-developer create the analytics dashboard UI"

  3. Quality Phase:
     "Use test-automator to generate comprehensive test suite"
     "Have security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
     "Use performance-engineer to optimize query performance"

  4. Deployment Phase:
     "Use deployment-engineer to set up CI/CD pipeline"
     "Have observability-engineer add monitoring"

  3.2 Plugin Combinations for Common Tasks

  Database Schema Changes:
  /database-operations:sql-migrations  # Slash command for migrations
  # Or agent invocation:
  "Use database-architect to design user preferences schema"
  "Have database-optimizer analyze query performance impact"

  API Development:
  # Install both plugins for complete API workflow
  /plugin install api-scaffolding
  /plugin install api-testing-observability

  # Then use:
  "Use api-scaffolding to generate CRUD API for contacts"
  "Have api-testing-observability create integration tests"

  Security Hardening:
  # Multi-agent security workflow
  "Use security-auditor to scan the codebase"
  "Have backend-security-coder implement input validation"
  "Use frontend-security-coder to add XSS protection"

  Phase 4: Integration with Task Master

  4.1 Combine with Task Master Workflow

  Your existing Task Master setup can leverage these agents:

  # Get next task from Task Master
  task-master next

  # Example task: "Implement chat message threading"
  # Use appropriate agents:
  "Use backend-architect to design the threading schema"
  "Have database-architect optimize for nested queries"
  "Use frontend-developer to implement thread UI"

  # Update task with progress
  task-master update-subtask --id=1.2 --prompt="Implemented threading schema with agents"
  task-master set-status --id=1.2 --status=done

  4.2 Agent-Enhanced Task Expansion

  # When expanding tasks, specify agent expertise needed
  task-master expand --id=2 --prompt="Break this into subtasks, considering:
  - Backend API work (backend-architect)
  - Database schema (database-architect)
  - Frontend components (frontend-developer)
  - Testing (test-automator)
  - Security review (security-auditor)"

  Phase 5: Recommended Plugin Installation Order

  Week 1: Foundation

  /plugin install claude-code-essentials
  /plugin install full-stack-development
  /plugin install database-operations

  Week 2: Development

  /plugin install api-scaffolding
  /plugin install testing-quality-suite
  /plugin install security-scanning

  Week 3: Infrastructure

  /plugin install deployment-orchestration
  /plugin install observability-monitoring
  /plugin install cicd-automation

  Week 4: Specialized

  /plugin install documentation-generation  # API docs
  /plugin install performance-optimization  # Performance tuning
  /plugin install accessibility-compliance  # WCAG compliance

  Phase 6: Best Practices

  6.1 Agent Invocation Patterns

  Explicit invocation (recommended):
  "Use [agent-name] to [specific task]"
  "Have [agent-name] [action]"

  Multi-agent coordination:
  "Coordinate backend-architect, database-architect, and frontend-developer to implement user profiles"

  6.2 Workflow Orchestrators

  Use full-stack-development plugin for complete features:
  "Implement real-time notifications feature"
  # Plugin automatically coordinates:
  # → backend-architect → database-architect → frontend-developer
  # → mobile-developer → test-automator → security-auditor
  # → performance-engineer → deployment-engineer

  6.3 Custom Slash Commands

  Create .claude/commands/feature-implement.md:
  Implement a new feature using multi-agent workflow: $ARGUMENTS

  Steps:
  1. Use backend-architect to design API
  2. Have database-architect design schema
  3. Use api-scaffolding to generate endpoints
  4. Have frontend-developer create UI
  5. Use test-automator to generate tests
  6. Have security-auditor review
  7. Update task-master with progress

  Phase 7: EventOS-Specific Workflows

  Chat System Enhancement

  # Plugin: full-stack-development
  "Implement chat message reactions feature with:
  - Real-time updates via Supabase
  - Emoji picker component
  - Analytics tracking"

  CRM Pipeline

  Next Steps

  I can now execute this plan by:

  1. Starting with marketplace addition and essential plugin installation
  2. Testing agent invocation with a sample task from your EventOS project
  3. Creating custom workflows tailored to your chat/CRM/dashboard features
  4. Integrating with Task Master for seamless task execution

  Would you like me to:
  - Start executing the plan (add marketplace + install plugins)?
  - Focus on a specific EventOS feature (chat/CRM/dashboard) to demonstrate multi-agent workflow?
  - Create custom slash commands for your most common workflows?
