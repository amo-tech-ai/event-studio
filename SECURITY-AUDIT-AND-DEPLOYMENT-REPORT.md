## 🚨 Security Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: Unprotected Environment Files ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ Remediated & Deployed

**Problem:**
- `.env.backup` and `.env.vercel` contained real API keys
- Files were not in `.gitignore`
- Risk of accidental commit to GitHub

**Exposed Credentials:**
```
✗ GitHub Personal Access Token
✗ Anthropic API Key
✗ OpenAI API Key
✗ Perplexity API Key
✗ Google API Key
✗ Supabase Personal Access Tokens
✗ Database Password (Toronto2025#)
✗ Vercel Tokens
```

**Fix Applied:**
```gitignore
# Added to .gitignore:
.env.*          # Ignores ALL .env.* variants
!.env.example   # Except safe template
```

**Verification:**
```bash
✅ Git refuses to add .env.backup
✅ Git refuses to add .env.vercel
✅ All environment files protected
✅ Template .env.example remains tracked
```

### Issue #2: GitHub Token in Git Remote URL ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ Remediated & Deployed

**Problem:**
```bash
# BEFORE (DANGEROUS):
origin https://ghp_[REDACTED]@github.com/amo-tech-ai/event-studio.git
```

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# AFTER (SECURE):
origin https://github.com/amo-tech-ai/event-studio.git
```

**Verification:**
```bash
✅ Remote URL clean
✅ No embedded credentials
✅ Push successful without token in URL
```

## ⚠️ Important Note: API Key Security

While we've secured the repository, the API keys in `.env.backup` were **exposed in plaintext** on your local machine. Best practice recommendations:

### Optional (Recommended for Production):
1. **Rotate Exposed Keys** (if this becomes public)
   - GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Anthropic API Key
   - OpenAI API Key
   - Other exposed credentials

2. **Change Database Password**
   - Current: `Toronto2025#` (exposed)
   - Via Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database

### Current Status:
- ✅ Keys are now protected from git
- ✅ Cannot be committed accidentally
- ✅ Safe for private repository use
- ⚠️ Should rotate if repo becomes public
