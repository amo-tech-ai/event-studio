# 🎯 EventOS MVP Master Plan

**Project:** EventOS Minimum Viable Product
**Planning Date:** 2025-10-17
**Implementation Timeline:** 4 Weeks
**Current Status:** Phase 0 Complete ✅
**Philosophy:** Launch fast, learn from users, iterate based on real feedback

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

This plan focuses on launching the absolute minimum viable product to validate the core business model: **event organizers need an easy way to create events and sell tickets.**

We intentionally avoid speculation about advanced features (AI, analytics, automation) until we have real users telling us what they actually need.

---

## 🎯 Current State (Phase 0 - COMPLETE ✅)

### Deployed Database Schema

| **Category** | **Tables** | **Status** |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **Core** | events, attendees, orders, venues, organizers | ✅ Live |
| **Ticketing** | ticket_tiers, order_items | ✅ Live |
| **Payments** | payments | ✅ Live |
| **Event Wizard** | event_sessions, session_bookings, marketing_campaigns | ✅ Live |
| **Dashboards** | event_dashboards | ✅ Live |
| **Email** | email_templates | ✅ Live |

**Total Tables:** 13 (Phase 0)
**Security:** RLS policies active on all tables
**Performance:** Indexes optimized
**Status:** Production ready

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: MVP Launch (4 Weeks)

### What We're Building

**Only 3 features:**
1. **Create Event** - Organizer creates event with basic info (name, date, description, location, ticket price, quantity)
2. **Public Event Page** - Anyone can view event at public URL
3. **Buy Ticket** - Attendee can purchase ticket via Stripe and receive confirmation email

**That's it.** Nothing else.

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)

❌ Multiple ticket types
❌ Dashboard analytics
❌ Marketing automation
❌ AI content generation
❌ Chatbot
❌ Advanced reporting
❌ Discount codes
❌ Multi-language support
❌ Mobile app
❌ Event check-in
❌ Refund handling

**Why not?** We don't know if users actually need these features. Build them only if users request them.

### Phase 1 Architecture

**New Tables:** 0 (using existing Phase 0 tables)
**New Features:** 3 (create, view, buy)
**Team Size:** 3 engineers
**Duration:** 4 weeks
**Infrastructure Cost:** $0/month (using free tiers)
**Development Cost:** $33,000

### Timeline

| **Week** | **Feature** | **Deliverable** |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | Auth + Create Event | Organizer can create event |
| 2 | Public Event Page | Anyone can view event online |
| 3 | Stripe Integration | Payment processing works |
| 4 | Email + Launch | Confirmation emails + go live |

### Success Criteria

MVP launches when:
- [ ] Organizer creates event in <3 minutes
- [ ] Public event page displays correctly
- [ ] Payment processing works (3 test purchases successful)
- [ ] Confirmation email arrives within 30 seconds
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Basic mobile responsive

### First Month Goals

- 10 events created
- 100 tickets sold
- <1% error rate
- Collect user feedback

---

## 🔍 Phase 2: TBD (Based on User Feedback)

**We don't define Phase 2 yet.**

After launching MVP and getting real users, we'll ask:
- What features do you need most?
- What problems are you experiencing?
- What would you pay more for?

**Then and only then** do we plan Phase 2.

### Potential Phase 2 Candidates (If Users Request)

Only build if users consistently request:
- Multiple ticket types (Early Bird, VIP, etc.)
- Basic dashboard with sales charts
- Discount codes
- Email marketing tools
- Event check-in functionality
- Refund handling
- Mobile responsive improvements

**Rule:** Don't build it unless users are willing to pay for it.

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Original Plan vs. MVP Plan

| **Metric** | **Original Plan** | **MVP Plan** | **Savings** |
|------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Timeline | 12 months | 4 weeks | 92% faster |
| Development Cost | $198,000 | $33,000 | 83% cheaper |
| Team Size | 7 people | 3 people | 57% smaller |
| Infrastructure/Month | $2,675 | $0 | 100% cheaper |
| Tables to Build | 35 new tables | 0 new tables | 100% less complexity |
| Features | 50+ features | 3 features | Focus |

### MVP Monthly Costs

| **Service** | **Tier** | **Cost** |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Supabase | Free (500MB, 2GB bandwidth) | $0 |
| Vercel | Hobby | $0 |
| Stripe | Pay per transaction | 2.9% + $0.30 |
| Resend | Free (100 emails/day) | $0 |
| **Total** | - | **$0/month** |

**Note:** Only pay Stripe fees when making sales. Zero upfront infrastructure cost.

---

## ⚠️ Accepted Limitations

These are known limitations we're **accepting** for the MVP:

| **Limitation** | **Impact** | **Decision** |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Only 1 ticket type per event | Can't have tiered pricing | Fix in Phase 2 if users request |
| No analytics dashboard | Organizers can't see charts | Fix if users complain |
| No refund system | Manual refunds only | Fix if it becomes a problem |
| Buy one ticket at a time | No cart system | Fix if users request |
| No discount codes | Can't run promotions | Fix if users need it |
| English only | No translations | Fix if going global |

**Philosophy:** Only fix what users actually complain about. Don't speculate.

---

## 🎯 Success Definition

### MVP Succeeds If:

**Validation Metrics (First Month):**
- ✅ 10 organizers create events
- ✅ 100 tickets sold successfully
- ✅ Users provide clear feedback on what they need next
- ✅ <5 critical bugs reported
- ✅ 80%+ users can complete core workflows without support

**Then we decide:** Is this a viable business? What should we build next?

### MVP Fails If:

- ❌ No one creates events
- ❌ No one buys tickets
- ❌ Critical technical failures prevent core workflows
- ❌ Users abandon the platform without telling us why

**If MVP fails:** We learn quickly and pivot, having only spent $33K and 4 weeks.

## 📅 Implementation Approach

### Week 1: Authentication + Event Creation
- Set up Supabase Auth (email/password only)
- Build event creation form (6 fields)
- Create API endpoints for CRUD
- Implement RLS policies
- **Milestone:** Organizer can create first event

### Week 2: Public Event Page
- Build public event listing page
- Create individual event detail page
- Add ticket availability counter
- Add "Buy Ticket" button
- Make mobile responsive
- **Milestone:** Anyone can view events online

### Week 3: Stripe Integration
- Integrate Stripe Checkout
- Build webhook handler
- Save orders to database
- Test payment flow
- Handle success/failure states
- **Milestone:** First successful test purchase

### Week 4: Email + Launch
- Set up Resend for transactional emails
- Create confirmation email template
- Build success page
- End-to-end testing
- Fix critical bugs
- **Milestone:** MVP goes live

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Essential Security (MVP)

**Authentication:**
- Email/password via Supabase Auth
- Email verification required
- Password reset functionality

**Row Level Security:**
```sql
-- Organizers see only their events
CREATE POLICY "own_events" ON events
USING (auth.uid() = organizer_id);

-- Public read access for published events
CREATE POLICY "view_events" ON events FOR SELECT
USING (true);

-- Users see only their orders
CREATE POLICY "own_orders" ON orders FOR SELECT
USING (email = auth.jwt()->>'email');
```

**Payment Security:**
- Stripe handles all payment data (PCI compliant)
- No credit card data stored locally
- Webhook signature verification

**What We're Skipping (For Now):**
- Advanced audit logging
- 2FA/MFA
- OAuth providers (Google, Facebook)
- IP rate limiting
- Advanced fraud detection

**Add these only if users request or if security issues arise.**

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

| **Risk** | **Likelihood** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Stripe integration fails | Low | Use official SDK, thorough testing |
| Email deliverability issues | Low | Use reputable provider (Resend) |
| Database performance | Low | Proper indexes already in place |
| Security vulnerabilities | Medium | Security audit before launch |

### Business Risks

| **Risk** | **Likelihood** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| No one uses it | Medium | Quick launch to validate fast |
| Feature gaps vs competitors | High | Accept for MVP, iterate based on feedback |
| Users want features we don't have | High | That's the goal - learn what to build |

---

## 📈 Decision Framework for Phase 2

After 30 days of MVP being live, evaluate:

### Build Feature If:
✅ At least 5 users request it
✅ Users say they'd pay for it
✅ It solves a painful problem
✅ It doesn't overly complicate the platform

### Don't Build Feature If:
❌ Only 1-2 users request it
❌ It's "nice to have" not "must have"
❌ There's a simple workaround
❌ It requires significant technical complexity

### Phase 2 Planning Process:
1. **Collect feedback** for 30 days
2. **Categorize requests** by frequency and importance
3. **Prioritize** top 3-5 most requested features
4. **Estimate** effort and cost
5. **Decide** what to build in Phase 2
6. **Repeat** this process for Phase 3, 4, etc.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Ship Fast
4 weeks from start to launch. No exceptions. Cut scope if needed.

### 2. Spend Nothing
$0 monthly infrastructure by using free tiers. Scale up only when revenue proven.

### 3. Learn First
Get real user feedback before building advanced features. Don't speculate.

### 4. Focus Ruthlessly
3 features only. Everything else is Phase 2+. Resist feature creep.

### 5. Validate Before Scaling
Prove the core business model works before investing in growth features.
