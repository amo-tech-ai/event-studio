| **Conflict Type** | **Resolution Strategy** | **Example** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Contradictory Recommendations** | Orchestrator evaluates confidence scores | Marketing suggests "Send now" vs. Personalization suggests "Wait 2 hours" ‚Üí Higher confidence wins |
| **Resource Competition** | Priority-based allocation | Content and Marketing both need API quota ‚Üí Higher priority task gets quota first |
| **Goal Ambiguity** | Request human clarification | Multiple valid interpretations ‚Üí Ask organizer to clarify |
| **Risk Assessment** | Conservative approach wins | One agent says "safe", one says "risky" ‚Üí Choose safe option |

### Safety & Guardrails

| **Safeguard** | **Purpose** | **Implementation** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Human Approval** | Critical decisions require human OK | All actions above risk threshold |
| **Action Limits** | Prevent runaway automation | Max N actions per hour per agent |
| **Confidence Threshold** | Don't act on uncertain recommendations | Require >75% confidence |
| **Rollback Capability** | Undo agent actions if needed | All actions logged with undo function |
| **Monitoring Dashboard** | Observe agent behavior | Real-time agent activity feed |
