#### 🔴 Critical Errors

**Error 3: Missing pgvector Extension Installation**
- **Line 324**: Says "pgvector: Semantic search in knowledge base"
- **Problem**: NEVER mentions when/how to install pgvector extension
- **Impact**: Chatbot semantic search will FAIL without this
- **Fix**: Add explicit installation step in Week 11 before chatbot deployment

```markdown
### Week 11 Prerequisites:
- [ ] Install pgvector extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;`
- [ ] Verify vector operations work
- [ ] Create vector indexes on knowledge_base_articles
```

**Error 4: Optimistic Cost Estimates**
- **Claims**: $500-1500/month for OpenAI API
- **Reality**: At scale (100+ organizers, 1000+ events), costs will be $5K-15K/month
- **Missing**: Embedding costs for chatbot knowledge base
- **Fix**: Increase estimates 5-10x for realistic production costs

#### 🟡 Warnings

1. **Performance targets**: <2 second dashboard might be hard with complex aggregations
2. **Chatbot accuracy**: 80% resolution rate is achievable but will take iteration
3. **Content quality**: 80% time reduction assumes AI quality is immediately acceptable

- **Problem**: This requires IVFFlat indexes which are NEVER mentioned
- **Reality**: Without proper indexes, vector search will be 10-100x slower
- **Fix**: Add explicit index creation step

```markdown
### Required Vector Indexes:
```sql
-- Phase 2, Week 2: Create IVFFlat indexes for fast similarity search
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_session_embeddings_vector
ON session_embeddings
USING ivfflat (embedding_vector vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_attendee_embeddings_vector
ON attendee_embeddings
USING ivfflat (embedding_vector vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);
```
```
