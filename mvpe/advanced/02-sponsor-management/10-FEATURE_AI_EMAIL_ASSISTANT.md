Subject: Quick question about GreenSound Festival partnership

Hi Lisa,

I wanted to follow up on the GreenSound Festival partnership proposal I sent earlier this week.

I know you're probably reviewing several opportunities, so I thought I'd share a quick insight that might be helpful in your decision-making process.

Our sustainability-focused audience has shown incredible engagement with eco-friendly brands:
â€¢ 89% actively seek sustainable products
â€¢ 72% prefer sustainable fashion brands
â€¢ 65% are willing to pay premium for sustainable products

This aligns perfectly with EcoStyle Apparel's mission and could generate significant brand awareness and customer acquisition.

Quick question: What's the most important factor in your partnership decisions - brand awareness, lead generation, or customer engagement?

I'd love to tailor our proposal to focus on your top priority.

Best regards,
Mike Johnson

#### **Email 2 - Day 7 Follow-up:**
```
Subject: EcoStyle + GreenSound = Perfect Match

Hi Lisa,

I hope you're having a great week! I wanted to share something exciting that just came in.

We just completed our final attendee survey, and the results are even better than expected for sustainable fashion brands:

â€¢ 94% of attendees are interested in sustainable fashion
â€¢ 87% follow sustainable fashion influencers
â€¢ 82% have made purchases based on influencer recommendations

This means EcoStyle Apparel could reach a highly engaged audience that's already interested in your products and values.

I've attached an updated proposal that includes:
â€¢ Influencer collaboration opportunities
â€¢ Social media content creation
â€¢ Sustainable fashion showcase area
â€¢ Post-event brand impact report

Would you be available for a 10-minute call to discuss how we can maximize your brand impact at GreenSound Festival?

I have openings tomorrow at 2 PM or Friday at 11 AM.

Best regards,

```

#### **Email 3 - Day 14 Final Follow-up:**
```
Subject: Last chance for GreenSound Festival partnership

Hi Lisa,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out one final time about the GreenSound Festival partnership opportunity.

I understand you're probably evaluating multiple opportunities, and I respect that decision-making process.

However, I wanted to let you know that we're down to our last 2 partnership slots, and I'd hate for EcoStyle Apparel to miss out on this incredible opportunity to connect with 15,000+ sustainability-focused millennials.

If you're interested but need more information, I'm happy to:
â€¢ Provide additional case studies
â€¢ Connect you with past partners for references
â€¢ Customize the proposal further
â€¢ Discuss flexible payment terms

If this isn't the right fit for EcoStyle Apparel right now, I completely understand. I'll remove you from our outreach list and won't follow up again.

But if you're interested, please let me know by Friday, and I'll reserve your partnership slot.

Best regards,
Mike Johnson

P.S. I've attached a brief video message from last year's sustainable fashion partner sharing their experience and results.
