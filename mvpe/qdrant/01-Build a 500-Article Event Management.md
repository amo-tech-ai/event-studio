# üß† How to Build a 500-Article Event Management Knowledge Base in Qdrant

Think of Qdrant as the **search brain** for your knowledge base ‚Äî it stores article meanings (vectors), so when someone asks a question like *‚ÄúHow do I track sponsor ROI?‚Äù*, Qdrant instantly finds the most relevant answers, even if the wording is different.

---

## üéØ Goal

Create a **smart, searchable knowledge base (KB)** of 500 short articles about event management ‚Äî covering planning, ticketing, sponsorships, marketing, and post-event analytics ‚Äî all stored in **Qdrant Cloud** for instant AI retrieval and RAG workflows.

---

## ü™ú Step-by-Step Plan

### **1. Plan the KB structure**

Break your 500 articles into **8 event phases** (your existing framework):

| Phase             | Example Topics                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| I. Inception      | Event ideas, feasibility, budgeting |
| II. Planning      | Venues, logistics, branding         |
| III. Sponsorships | ROI tracking, tiered packages       |
| IV. Marketing     | Social media, WhatsApp automation   |
| V. Ticketing      | Stripe Connect, refunds, CRM        |
| VI. Pre-Event Ops | Staff, vendors, rehearsals          |
| VII. Live Event   | Entry management, safety            |
| VIII. Post-Event  | Feedback, reporting, analytics      |

Each article should answer a real problem in 3‚Äì6 short steps and include **tips + real examples** (e.g., ‚ÄúUsed by Medell√≠n Fashion Week 2025‚Äù).

---

### **2. Define the data model**

Each article (or chunk) you upload to Qdrant should include:

```json
{
  "id": "evt-0123:01",
  "title": "How to use Stripe Connect for ticket payouts",
  "text": "...content...",
  "phase": "V.Ticketing",
  "roles": ["Organizer", "Finance"],
  "tags": ["stripe", "payments"],
  "language": "en",
  "source": "010-prd.md",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-21T00:00:00Z"
}
```

This metadata helps you **filter** results later (e.g., only show ‚ÄúPhase V‚Äù content for finance roles).

---

### **3. Create your Qdrant collection**

Use Python and your Qdrant Cloud credentials:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams

client = QdrantClient(url="https://YOUR-URL.qdrant.tech", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

client.recreate_collection(
    collection_name="event_kb",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=768, distance=Distance.COSINE)
)
```

> **Tip:** ‚Äúsize‚Äù must match your embedding model (e.g., 768 for `text-embedding-3-small`).

---

### **4. Prepare your articles**

* Clean up markdown (remove footers/navigation)
* Split long docs into smaller **chunks (500‚Äì800 words)**
* Add a short intro + bullet steps per chunk
* Save in structured JSON or Markdown with frontmatter

Example:
`010-prd.md` ‚Üí becomes 8 articles:
`Creating an Event`, `Choosing a Venue`, `Ticketing Setup`, etc.

---

### **5. Embed and upload**

For each chunk:

1. **Generate embeddings** (numerical meaning vectors)

   * Use OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Voyage AI models.
2. **Upsert to Qdrant** (store text + vector + metadata).

Example:

```python
from qdrant_client.models import PointStruct
import uuid

def embed(text): ...  # returns vector list
points = [
  PointStruct(id=str(uuid.uuid4()), vector=embed(text), payload=payload)
]
client.upsert(collection_name="event_kb", points=points)
```

---

### **6. Test your search**

Ask natural questions and see if Qdrant finds the right articles:

```python
results = client.search(
  collection_name="event_kb",
  query_vector=embed("how to handle refunds for tickets"),
  limit=5,
  with_payload=True
)

for hit in results:
    print(hit.payload["title"], hit.score)
```

Expected output ‚Üí relevant results like:

* ‚ÄúRefunds & Chargebacks Best Practices‚Äù
* ‚ÄúStripe Dispute Handling for Organizers‚Äù

---

### **7. Connect it to your AI assistant**

Once articles are in Qdrant, connect it to your **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system ‚Äî such as **LangChain**, **CopilotKit**, or **CrewAI** ‚Äî so users can ask natural questions.

Typical flow:

```
User asks ‚Üí Query Qdrant ‚Üí Retrieve top 5 results ‚Üí AI composes summary ‚Üí Cite sources
```

---

### **8. Quality & maintenance**

| Task                 | Frequency          | Purpose                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Check query accuracy | Monthly            | Ensure relevant results |
| Add new articles     | Ongoing            | Keep KB growing         |
| Update embeddings    | When models change | Maintain quality        |
| Backup collection    | Weekly             | Protect data            |

---

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start small:** 50 articles first, test search, then scale to 500.
2. **Use hybrid search (dense + keyword)** for better precision.
3. **Tag everything** ‚Äî phase, role, and language make filtering powerful.
4. **Write simply:** focus on actions, not theory.
5. **Re-use content:** your PRDs, tech docs, and user journeys already contain ~200 articles‚Äô worth of material.

---

## üß© Real-World Example

* **Company:** Medell√≠n Fashion Week
* **Use case:** 500 internal KB articles for organizers, sponsors, designers
* **Result:** AI assistant answers event questions in seconds
  (‚ÄúHow to price VIP tickets?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to generate sponsor reports?‚Äù)
* **Tech:** Qdrant Cloud + OpenAI embeddings + Supabase CMS

Would you like me to generate a **ready-to-use Python script** that:

* Reads Markdown docs (e.g., `/docs/*.md`),
* Splits them into chunks,
* Embeds them with OpenAI, and
* Uploads them to your Qdrant Cloud automatically?
