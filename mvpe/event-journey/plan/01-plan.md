I'll examine the current setup and create a plan for the registration flow based on the EventOS system and Luma's registration process.

Now let me examine the current EventOS codebase to understand the existing structure:

The user is asking me to create a plan for the event registration flow after a user clicks "register" on an event. They referenced:

1. Luma platform's event registration process 
2. The existing EventOS system
3. Event journey documentation
4. Lovable event pages (though those were empty)

I've been examining the codebase and found:
- There's an EventDetails page with a "Register Now" button
- There are Auth pages for login/signup
- But I haven't found any dedicated registration/checkout/purchase pages yet
- The user wants a simple, natural language plan with diagrams

I should stop trying to find files that don't exist and instead create the plan they requested based on what I've found and the Luma reference they provided.

Let me create a comprehensive registration flow plan that integrates with the existing EventOS system and follows the Decision/Purchase stage from the event journey documentation.

Based on my analysis of the EventOS codebase and the Luma registration process reference, here's the **Event Registration Flow Plan**:

## üéØ **Event Registration Flow - Simple Plan**

### **Current State Analysis**
- ‚úÖ EventDetails page exists with "Register Now" button
- ‚úÖ Authentication system in place (`/auth`)
- ‚ùå Missing dedicated registration/checkout flow
- ‚ùå No payment processing integration
- ‚ùå No order confirmation system

### **Registration Flow Steps**

#### **1. Registration Initiation**
**User Action:** Clicks "Register Now" on EventDetails page
**Current Status:** Button exists but no handler implemented
**Next Step:** Route to registration flow

#### **2. Authentication Check**
**User Journey:** 
- If not logged in ‚Üí Redirect to `/auth` (login/signup)
- If logged in ‚Üí Proceed to ticket selection
**Current Status:** Auth system exists, needs integration

#### **3. Ticket Selection & Pricing**
**User Journey:** Select ticket type, quantity, add-ons
**Missing Components:** 
- Ticket selection interface
- Pricing display
- Quantity selector

#### **4. Checkout & Payment**
**User Journey:** Enter payment details, process payment
**Missing Components:**
- Stripe integration
- Payment form
- Order processing

#### **5. Confirmation & Next Steps**
**User Journey:** Order confirmation, calendar invite, event details
**Missing Components:**
- Confirmation page
- Email notifications
- Calendar integration

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Core Registration Flow**
1. Create `EventRegistration.tsx` page
2. Add routing from EventDetails "Register Now" button
3. Implement ticket selection interface
4. Add basic order processing

#### **Phase 2: Payment Integration**
1. Integrate Stripe payment processing
2. Add payment form validation
3. Implement order confirmation
4. Add email notifications

#### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
1. Add calendar invite generation
2. Implement order tracking
3. Add refund/cancellation handling
4. Integrate with event journey analytics

### **Revenue Impact**
- **Direct Revenue:** Ticket sales processing
- **Conversion Optimization:** Streamlined checkout reduces abandonment
- **User Experience:** Professional registration builds trust
- **Analytics:** Track registration funnel performance

### **Success Metrics**
- **Conversion Rate:** Registration page ‚Üí completed purchase
- **Abandonment Rate:** Where users drop off in registration
- **Revenue Per Event:** Average order value
- **Time to Complete:** Registration completion time

### **Technical Architecture**
```typescript
// Registration Flow Components Needed:
- EventRegistration.tsx (main registration page)
- TicketSelector.tsx (ticket type selection)
- PaymentForm.tsx (Stripe integration)
- OrderConfirmation.tsx (success page)
- RegistrationService.ts (backend logic)
```

### **Integration Points**
- **Supabase:** Store orders, payments, attendee data
- **Stripe:** Payment processing
- **Email Service:** Confirmations and reminders
- **Calendar API:** Event invitations
- **Analytics:** Track conversion funnel

### **Next Actions**
1. **Immediate:** Create basic registration page structure
2. **Week 1:** Implement ticket selection and basic flow
3. **Week 2:** Add Stripe payment integration
4. **Week 3:** Add confirmation and email notifications
5. **Week 4:** Test and optimize conversion funnel

This plan creates a complete registration experience that converts event interest into ticket sales, directly driving revenue for the $75K/month target.
