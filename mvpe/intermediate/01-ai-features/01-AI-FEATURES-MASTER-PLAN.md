## 💡 Core AI Capabilities

### 1. **Conversational Interfaces (CopilotKit)**

**Pattern:** State Machine Copilots

```typescript
// Example: AI Event Wizard Stage
useCopilotAction({
  name: "suggestVenue",
  description: "AI recommends venues based on event requirements",
  parameters: [
    { name: "capacity", type: "number", required: true },
    { name: "budget", type: "number", required: true },
    { name: "location", type: "string", required: true }
  ],
  handler: async ({ capacity, budget, location }) => {
    // 1. Vector search for similar events
    const similarEvents = await vectorSearch(capacity, location);

    // 2. Score venues by match quality
    const venues = await scoreVenues(capacity, budget, location);

    // 3. Return top 3 with reasoning
    return formatVenueRecommendations(venues, similarEvents);
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Natural language interaction
- Context preservation across stages
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- State persistence and recovery

---

### 2. **AI Agent System (LangChain + CrewAI)**

**Architecture:** CoAgents with Sequential Orchestration

```python
# Example: Sponsor Outreach Agent
class SponsorOutreachAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
        self.tools = [
            LinkedInSearchTool(),
            EmailDraftTool(),
            CRMUpdateTool()
        ]

    async def find_and_engage(self, event_id: str):
        # 1. Analyze event profile
        event = await self.analyze_event(event_id)

        # 2. Search for matching sponsors
        prospects = await self.find_prospects(
            industry=event.industry,
            budget_range=event.target_sponsorship,
            values=event.values
        )

        # 3. Score and prioritize
        scored = await self.score_leads(prospects)

        # 4. Generate personalized outreach
        for prospect in scored[:10]:
            email = await self.draft_email(event, prospect)
            await self.send_with_tracking(email)

        return {
            "prospects_found": len(prospects),
            "emails_sent": len(scored[:10]),
            "expected_response_rate": 0.15
        }
```

---

### 3. **Predictive Analytics (Custom ML)**

**Models:**

```python
# Ticket Pricing Model
class DynamicPricingModel:
    """
    Predicts optimal ticket prices based on:
    - Historical sales data
    - Event characteristics (type, size, location)
    - Market demand signals
    - Competitor pricing
    """

    def predict_optimal_price(self, event_features):
        # Feature engineering
        features = self.extract_features(event_features)

        # Model ensemble
        base_price = self.xgboost_model.predict(features)
        demand_adj = self.demand_model.predict(features)

        # Apply constraints
        optimal = self.apply_constraints(
            base_price * demand_adj,
            min_price=event_features.min_price,
            max_price=event_features.max_price
        )

        return {
            "base_price": base_price,
            "demand_multiplier": demand_adj,
            "optimal_price": optimal,
            "confidence": self.calculate_confidence(features)
        }
```

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### AI-First Interface Principles

1. **Conversational by Default**
   - Primary interactions through natural language
   - GUI as secondary option, not primary
   - Example: "Create a tech conference in San Francisco for 500 people"

2. **Proactive Suggestions**
   - AI anticipates next steps
   - Surfaces relevant recommendations
   - Example: "Based on your event type, here are 3 sponsor matches"

3. **Transparent AI**
   - Always explain reasoning
   - Show confidence scores
   - Allow human override
   - Example: "I recommend $299 (85% confidence) based on 147 similar events"

4. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start simple, add complexity gradually
   - AI handles defaults, user customizes
   - Example: "I've created standard tiers. Want to customize pricing?"

5. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - AI proposes, human approves
   - Critical decisions require confirmation
   - Example: "Ready to send these sponsor emails? [Review First] [Send Now]"
