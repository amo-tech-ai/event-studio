## 💡 Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI-First Event Creation

**Problem:** Creating events in traditional platforms takes 30-60 minutes of form filling

**Zoho's Approach:**
- Manual form entry
- Template selection
- Step-by-step wizards

**EventOS Solution:**
```
User: "I need to create a tech conference for 500 people"
AI: "Great! When and where is your event?"
User: "December 15 in San Francisco"
AI: "I found 3 venues that fit 500 people. Do you prefer SF Convention Center?"
User: "Yes, that works"
AI: "Perfect! Let's configure tickets. I suggest Early Bird $99, General $149, VIP $299"
User: "Create it"
AI: "✅ Done! Your event is live at eventos.com/tech-conf-2025"
```

**Time Savings:** 5 minutes vs. 45 minutes
**Technology:** CopilotKit + OpenAI GPT-4o
**Competitive Advantage:** 9x faster event creation

---

### Pillar 2: WhatsApp Business Integration

- No benchmarking

**EventOS Solution:**
