### 4. Data Relationships Verification ✅

#### Events → Orders → Tickets Flow

Tested query:
```sql
select
  e.name as event_name,
  count(distinct o.id) as order_count,
  count(distinct t.id) as ticket_count,
  sum(o.total_cents) / 100.0 as total_revenue
from events e
left join orders o on e.id = o.event_id
left join tickets t on o.id = t.order_id
group by e.id, e.name;
```

**Results:**
- AI & Machine Learning Summit 2025: 1 order, 2 tickets, $1,196 revenue
