```

**✅ Checkpoint:** Can create data hooks and components

---

### Week 2-5: Feature Implementation (120 hours)
```bash
# START HERE: Dashboard Implementation
→ 03-features/dashboard/tasks/00-TASK-INDEX.md

# Phase 0: Infrastructure (8 hours)
Tasks 01-06: Database → TypeScript → Components

# Week 2: Database Integration (55 hours)
Tasks 07-13: Connect all pages to database

# Week 3: Real-time (16 hours)
Tasks 14-15: Live updates & optimization

# Week 4: Missing Pages (44 hours)
Tasks 16-20: Calendar, Analytics, Settings, etc.

# Week 5: Polish & Deploy (24 hours)

```

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Follow task order strictly** (dependencies mapped)
2. **Mark tasks complete** as you finish
3. **Reference foundation docs** when stuck
4. **Use reference folder** for quick API lookups

**✅ Checkpoint:** All 27 tasks complete, production ready
