# Stage 3: Venue Selection

## Overview

Stage 3 leverages EventOS's venue marketplace to recommend and book venues. This is a key differentiator vs. Zoho Backstage, which lacks venue discovery features. The AI suggests venues based on capacity, date, location, and event type.

**Duration:** ~90 seconds
**Transition:** venue_selection ‚Üí ticketing

---

## Purpose

- Recommend venues from EventOS marketplace
- Support custom venue entry (if organizer has their own)
- Create venue booking record
- Negotiate pricing (for marketplace venues)
- Link venue to event

---

## State Structure

```typescript
interface VenueSelectionState {
  venueData: {
    venueId?: string;
    venueName?: string;
    venueType?: "marketplace" | "custom";
    address?: string;
    capacity?: number;
    amenities?: string[];
    pricing?: {
      basePrice?: number;
      currency?: string;
      negotiated?: boolean;
    };
    bookingId?: string;
  };
}
```

---

## CopilotKit Implementation

### Hook: `useVenueSelectionStage.ts`

```typescript
import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { useWizardState } from "../hooks/useWizardState";
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase";

export function useVenueSelectionStage() {
  const { state, updateState, goToStage, markStageComplete } = useWizardState();

  // Action 1: Search and recommend venues from marketplace

## Database Operations

### 1. Venue Search Query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM venues
WHERE
  capacity >= 500
  AND status = 'active'
  AND marketplace_listing = true
  AND city ILIKE '%San Francisco%'
  AND 'projector' = ANY(amenities)
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 2. Availability Check

```sql
SELECT id
FROM venue_bookings
WHERE
  venue_id = 'venue-uuid'
  AND status = 'confirmed'
  AND event_date_range && daterange('2025-03-15', '2025-03-15', '[]');
```

### 3. Booking Request Creation

```sql
INSERT INTO venue_bookings (
  event_id,
  venue_id,
  event_date,
  status,
  attendee_count,
  requested_by,
  booking_source,
  metadata
) VALUES (
  'event-uuid',
  'venue-uuid',
  '2025-03-15',
  'pending',
  500,
  'sarah.johnson@techcorp.com',
  'wizard',
  '{"wizard_session_id": "session-uuid", "event_type": "conference"}'::jsonb
)
RETURNING *;
```

### 4. Event Update with Venue

```sql
-- Marketplace venue
UPDATE events
SET
  venue_id = 'venue-uuid',
  location = '123 Market St, San Francisco, CA'
WHERE id = 'event-uuid';

-- Custom venue
UPDATE events
SET
  location = 'TechCorp Office, 456 Mission St, San Francisco, CA',
  custom_venue = '{
    "name": "TechCorp Office",
    "address": "456 Mission St, San Francisco, CA",
    "capacity": 500
  }'::jsonb
WHERE id = 'event-uuid';
```

## Venue Matching Algorithm

The AI uses these factors to recommend venues:

### Primary Factors (Must Match)
- ‚úÖ **Capacity**: Venue capacity ‚â• event capacity
- ‚úÖ **Availability**: No confirmed bookings on event date
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Venue is active and accepting bookings

### Secondary Factors (Ranked)
- ‚≠ê **Rating**: Higher-rated venues ranked first
- üìç **Location**: Proximity to requested location
- üéØ **Amenities**: Matches requested features
- üí∞ **Price**: Within budget range (if specified)
- üèÜ **Event Type Match**: Venue suited for event type

### Scoring Example
```typescript
function scoreVenue(venue: Venue, requirements: Requirements): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Rating (0-50 points)
  score += (venue.rating || 0) * 10;

  // Amenity match (0-30 points)
  const matchedAmenities = requirements.amenities.filter(a =>
    venue.amenities.includes(a)
  ).length;
  score += (matchedAmenities / requirements.amenities.length) * 30;

  // Capacity buffer (0-10 points)
  // Prefer venues not too oversized
  const buffer = venue.capacity / requirements.capacity;
  score += buffer >= 1 && buffer <= 1.5 ? 10 : 0;

  // Price competitiveness (0-10 points)
  if (requirements.budget) {
    score += venue.base_price <= requirements.budget ? 10 : 0;
  }

  return score;
}
```

## Validation Rules

| Field | Required | Validation | Error Message |
|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| venueId (marketplace) | ‚úÖ Yes | Valid UUID | "Invalid venue selected" |
| venueName (custom) | ‚úÖ Yes | 3-100 chars | "Venue name required" |
| address (custom) | ‚úÖ Yes | Min 10 chars | "Please provide full address" |
| capacity (custom) | ‚ùå No | 1-100,000 | - |

---

## Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Venue recommendations based on event requirements
- ‚úÖ Availability check before booking
- ‚úÖ Booking request created for marketplace venues
- ‚úÖ Event linked to venue (marketplace or custom)
- ‚úÖ Global state updated with venue data
- ‚úÖ Stage marked complete
- ‚úÖ Automatic transition to ticketing stage

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. Venue Unavailable on Selected Date
**Scenario:** Chosen venue is already booked
**Action:** Notify user, offer alternatives or date change
**Message:** "That venue is booked on March 15. Try April 1st or select another venue?"

### 2. No Venues Match Criteria
**Scenario:** Search returns 0 results
**Action:** Offer to expand search or add custom venue
**Message:** "No venues found. Would you like to: 1) Expand search, 2) Add your own venue?"

### 3. Incomplete Address for Custom Venue
**Scenario:** User says "our office" without full address
**Action:** Request complete address
**Message:** "Could you provide the full address for your office?"

### 4. Capacity Mismatch
**Scenario:** User selects venue smaller than attendee count
**Action:** Warn about capacity issue
**Message:** "This venue fits 300 but you expect 500 attendees. Is that okay?"

## Analytics Events

```typescript
// Venue search initiated
analytics.track("venue_search_started", {
  location: location || "any",
