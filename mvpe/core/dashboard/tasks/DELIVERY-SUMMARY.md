## 🎯 Key Findings from Audit

### Current Status: 12% Complete

**What's Working (15%):**
- ✅ 6 dashboard pages created (54.5%)
- ✅ Sample data exists (5 events, 3 orders)
- ✅ Some feature modules exist (events, orders, crm, tickets)
- ✅ Events hooks implemented (useEvents, useEventMutations)

**What's Missing (88%):**
- 🔴 Zero database connectivity (100% mock data)
- 🔴 Phase 0 incomplete (85% missing)
- 🔴 TypeScript types not generated
- 🔴 Shared components not created
- 🔴 5 pages missing (Calendar, Analytics, Organizers, Venues, Settings)

**Critical Issues:**
- 🚩 Dashboard shows fake data (345 events vs real 5)
- 🚩 No TypeScript types → Will cause errors
- 🚩 No shared components → Code duplication
- 🚩 CRM tables empty → Blocks Organizers page
