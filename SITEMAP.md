## 🏗️ Application Architecture

### Provider Hierarchy
```
QueryClientProvider (React Query)
└── AuthProvider (Supabase Auth)
    └── TooltipProvider (Radix UI)
        └── BrowserRouter (React Router)
            └── Routes
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User Access Attempt
└── ProtectedRoute Check
    ├── VITE_DISABLE_AUTH=true → ✅ Bypass (Development)
    ├── Loading → Show Spinner
    ├── No Session → Redirect to /auth
    └── Valid Session → ✅ Render Protected Content
```

### Key Components
- **`ProtectedRoute.tsx`**: HOC that wraps protected routes, handles auth checks
- **`AuthContext.tsx`**: Provides auth state (user, session, loading) to entire app
- **`queryClient.ts`**: Configures React Query for data fetching/caching

---

## 🎯 Feature Modules Structure

### Current Status
**Implementation:** 0% (No feature modules created yet)

### Recommended Feature Modules
Based on the dashboard structure, these should exist:

1. **`/src/features/dashboard/`** - Dashboard overview hooks & components
2. **`/src/features/events/`** - Event management logic
3. **`/src/features/bookings/`** - Booking system
4. **`/src/features/financials/`** - Revenue tracking & reporting
5. **`/src/features/gallery/`** - Media management
6. **`/src/features/analytics/`** - Analytics & insights
7. **`/src/features/calendar/`** - Calendar views
8. **`/src/features/organizers/`** - Organizer profiles
9. **`/src/features/venues/`** - Venue management
10. **`/src/features/settings/`** - User preferences

---

## 🚨 Critical Findings

### 1. Database Connectivity: 0%
- All dashboard pages display **mock data only**
- No Supabase queries implemented
- No TanStack Query hooks created
- Pages show incorrect metrics (e.g., 345 events vs actual 5)

### 2. Missing Pages: 5
These routes redirect to Dashboard instead of dedicated pages:
- DashboardAnalytics
- DashboardCalendar
- DashboardOrganizers
- DashboardVenues
- DashboardSettings

### 3. Feature Module Architecture: Not Implemented
- Zero feature modules exist
- All logic currently in page components
- No separation of concerns for data fetching

### 4. Development Auth Bypass
- ✅ Successfully configured with `VITE_DISABLE_AUTH=true`
- Auth check happens in `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Console warning appears when bypassed

## 📈 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Infrastructure (Day 0 - 8 hours)
- [x] Disable auth for development
- [ ] Verify database schema (22 tables)
- [ ] Create sample data (5+ events, 3+ orders)
- [ ] Create feature module directories
- [ ] Generate TypeScript types from Supabase
- [ ] Build shared dashboard components

### Phase 1: Database Integration (Week 1-2)
Connect existing 6 dashboard pages to real data:
1. Dashboard.tsx - Overview stats
2. DashboardEvents.tsx - Event list
3. DashboardEventDetails.tsx - Event detail
4. DashboardBookings.tsx - Bookings
5. DashboardFinancials.tsx - Financials
6. DashboardGallery.tsx - Gallery

### Phase 2: Missing Pages (Week 3)
Create 5 placeholder pages:
1. DashboardAnalytics.tsx
2. DashboardCalendar.tsx
3. DashboardOrganizers.tsx
4. DashboardVenues.tsx
5. DashboardSettings.tsx

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
- Real-time updates
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Mobile responsiveness
- E2E testing
