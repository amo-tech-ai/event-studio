# 🧠 **AI Prompting Best Practices Guide**

### For Claude, Cursor, and Modern AI Development Tools

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**

To help developers, creators, and teams **communicate effectively with AI tools** (Claude, Cursor, CopilotKit, LangChain, etc.) for **reliable, high-quality, and production-ready outputs**.

AI tools are only as smart as your instructions. Prompting well means **thinking like a designer, engineer, and teacher simultaneously** — clear goal, structured guidance, measurable outcome.

## ⚙️ **1. Core Principles**

| Principle             | Why It Matters                              | Example                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be Clear & Direct** | AI models thrive on precision, not mystery. | ❌ “Make this better.” → ✅ “Rewrite this paragraph for clarity and professional tone.” |
| **Provide Context**   | Helps AI tailor its reasoning.              | “This is part of a Supabase setup guide for a fashion event platform.”                |
| **Define Role**       | Guides tone and depth.                      | “Act as a senior backend engineer.”                                                   |
| **Set Constraints**   | Prevents hallucination and ensures focus.   | “Keep response under 200 words. Use Markdown tables.”                                 |
| **Think in Steps**    | AI follows structure more than style.       | “Step 1: Analyze; Step 2: Suggest; Step 3: Validate.”                                 |

## 🔗 **2. Structured Prompt Framework**

A clear prompt follows this structure:

```plaintext
[ROLE / CONTEXT]
You are an [expert role]. Context: [specific goal or task].

[OBJECTIVE]
Your task: [what you want achieved].

[CONSTRAINTS]
Follow these rules: [limits, tone, format].

[PROCESS / STEPS]
1. Analyze [input/problem].
2. Generate [output].
3. Verify or critique your answer.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return results as: [Markdown table, code, summary, etc.].
```

✅ Example:

> You are an expert event operations architect.
> Task: Audit our Supabase + LangGraph integration.
> Steps: (1) Identify missing env vars, (2) verify connection logic, (3) give a success score /100.
> Output: Markdown checklist + summary. Keep it simple and actionable.

---

## 🧩 **3. Multi-Shot & Chain Prompting**

### **Multi-Shot (Give Examples)**

Give **2–3 examples** of correct behavior before asking for new output.

```plaintext
Example 1: “Simplify technical paragraph for a blog.”
→ Output: [Show ideal example]

Now, do the same for this paragraph:
[Your new input here]
```

### **Chain Prompts (Step-by-Step Reasoning)**

Break complex tasks into small, clear subtasks.

**Example Chain for an AI workflow:**

1. Extract technical content →
2. Rewrite for clarity →
3. Generate visual summary →
4. Validate factual accuracy.

> 💡 *Don’t ask one model to “do everything.” Ask it to do one thing well at a time.*

---

## 🔍 **4. Design Prompts Like You Design APIs**

| Good Prompt                                         | Bad Prompt                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| “Explain this in simple, professional English.”     | “Make this sound better.”  |
| “Use bullet points and real-world examples.”        | “Give me details.”         |
| “Act as an event planner using Supabase workflows.” | “Pretend you know events.” |

Think of a **prompt as a function signature** — each parameter (tone, depth, output format) defines the behavior.

---

## 💬 **5. System vs User Prompts (Claude / Cursor)**

| Type                      | Purpose                                   | Example                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **System Prompt**         | Permanent instruction (always true).      | “You are a senior full-stack engineer following official Supabase docs.” |
| **User Prompt**           | One-time instruction for a specific task. | “Generate schema diff commands for database migration.”                  |
| **Chain / Memory Prompt** | Persistent context or task state.         | “Now apply the same logic to Step 2: verify table indexes.”              |

**Best practice:**
Use **system prompts for identity and safety**, **user prompts for clarity and focus**, and **chain prompts for iterative refinement**.

## ⚙️ **6. Advanced Techniques**

| Technique                 | Description                        | Example                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **XML / JSON Wrapping**   | Keeps data structured for reuse.   | `<task>Summarize each function</task>`                     |
| **Prompt Chaining**       | Sequential prompts build accuracy. | Extract → Analyze → Rewrite → Validate                     |
| **Self-Correction Loops** | Ask AI to review its output.       | “Now grade your answer A–F for clarity and accuracy.”      |
| **Role Cycling**          | Switch perspectives.               | “Now act as a QA engineer reviewing your previous output.” |
| **Feedback Prompts**      | Continuous improvement.            | “What did you miss? Revise only the weak sections.”        |

## 🧠 **7. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

| Mistake                   | Why It Fails             | Fix                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Asking for “magic”        | Too vague for reasoning. | Give context + goal.         |
| Combining unrelated tasks | Overloads model context. | Split into separate prompts. |
| Missing output format     | Hard to parse results.   | Always specify format.       |
| Ignoring evaluation       | Hard to improve quality. | Add “rate yourself /100.”    |

2. Add foreign keys.
3. Enable RLS.
4. Add two example policies.
Output: PostgreSQL code block + comments.
```
